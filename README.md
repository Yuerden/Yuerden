👋 Hey there! I'm John Cohen, a Computer Science student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute who's passionate about crafting impactful applications.

🎓 Currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with minors in AI and Economics, I maintain a GPA of 3.65. You'll find me deeply engaged in all things tech.

🔭 I've contributed to a decentralized biomedical file sharing app, where I collaborated on both backend blockchain and frontend development using Node.js and React. This endeavor ties into an imminent research paper advocating for blockchain-driven medical data-set sharing, providing hands-on exposure to blockchain technology, distributed systems, and modern web development.

🛠️ Beyond my academic journey, I've actively contributed to a variety of projects. From managing a team to create an iOS tower defense game to developing a Python-based query expansion plugin, my experiences have shaped my proficiency in Swift programming, AGILE methodologies, and more. I am most proud of my ability to identify and solve problems I encounter in my everyday life. Dutch is one of these projects. Click [here]{https://github.com/Yuerden/Dutch} to view its repository.

🏆 As a leader, I've played diverse roles in Chi Phi fraternity, showcasing my ability to steer discussions, oversee operations, and lead productive meetings. Sports have also been a major part of my life, with 4 years as a varsity starter and 2 years as captain in Black and Blue Wrestling.

📚 My coursework spans Data Structures, Algorithms, Language-Endowed Intelligent Agents, Principles of Software, Software Design & Documentation, Operating Systems, Information Retrieval, Programming Languages, and Blockchain & AI Research.

💡 Awards and certifications I've earned include AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner, Andrew Spencer Colditz Scholarship for Young Leaders, Rensselaer Leadership Award, and Jeff Greenburg Coaches Award.
